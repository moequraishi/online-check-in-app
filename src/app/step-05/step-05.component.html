I intend by this Waiver and Release, in advance, to waive my rights, to covenant not to sue to release for future claims, and to discharge all of the persons and entities mentioned above, from any and all loss or damage, including, but not limited to claims for damages for death, personal injury or property damage that I may have, or which may hereafter accrue to me, as a result of my participation in all or any portion of this Event, even though that liability may arise from negligence, carelessness, or recklessness (whether simple or gross) on the part of the persons or entities being released, from dangerous or defective property or equipment owned, maintained, or controlled by them or because of their possible liability without fault.

I understand and agree that this Waiver and Release is binding on my heirs, assigns, and legal representatives.
